It's a simple Wordle game with emphasis put on the logic. It lacks some animations but should work completely fine with repeating letters and detecting&displaying yellow and green blocks.
It is scalable, i.e. should work fine if you change the constants for the number of words and guessed word in lines 21 and 22 of components/App.js. I planned to add "difficulty levels" but I didn't manage to add form support from the user.
